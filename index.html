    <!-- <p> I'm a professional Problem Solver, Performer, and Puppy-Petter </p> -->
    <p> Originally from Indiana, I reside in West Virginia with my husband, daughter, and two golden retrievers. I've spent almost 10 years working at start-ups and Fortune 500 companies in the DC Metro Area; and I danced professionally for NBA and NFL teams for seven years. In December 2023, I will graduate the Flatiron Software Engineer Bootcamp and hope to be employed as a Software Engineer as early as January 2024.</p>
